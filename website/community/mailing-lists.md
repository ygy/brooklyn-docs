Our main discussion list is our *dev* list - here you can ask questions and get
help with issues, ranging from basic getting started through to detailed
questions about Brooklyn's internals.

To subscribe, send an email to:
[dev-subscribe@brooklyn.apache.org](mailto:dev-subscribe@brooklyn.apache.org)

You can also [read and search the dev list
archives](https://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/brooklyn-dev/) on
Apache's list archiver.


### Other lists

We also have a *commits* list - a read-only list which automatically posts as
commits are made to our source repositories. Subscribe by sending an email to
[commits-subscribe@brooklyn.apache.org](mailto:commits-subscribe@brooklyn.apache.org),
and [read the archives here](https://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/brooklyn-commits/).


### Historical lists

Before Brooklyn graduated from the Apache Incubator, the lists included the word
"incubator" (e.g. dev@brooklyn.incubator.apache.org). These were automatically
migrated upon graduation; the old lists should not be used.

Before Brooklyn joined the Apache Incubator, we had lists hosted on Google
Groups. These lists are now deprecated and it's no longer possible to subscribe
or post, but you may find useful information in the archives.

- [Old Brooklyn users list archive](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/brooklyn-dev)
- [Old Brooklyn dev list archive](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/brooklyn-dev)

Once again, these lists are deprecated, so please subscribe to the Apache-hosted
lists to receive new messages.
